# üí¨ Mini Proj ‚Äì Scalable Chat Application

A real-time, highly-scalable chat application built using **Next.js + TypeScript** on the frontend, and **Apache Kafka** for the messaging backbone.

## üîç Project Overview

This project showcases a chat system designed for high throughput and real-time communication. With Kafka at its core, message delivery is decoupled from the client logic ‚Äî enabling reliability, scalability, and flexibility.

Key components:
- A modern frontend built with Next.js and TypeScript for fast, maintainable UI.
- A backend service (or API routes) producing and consuming messages via Kafka.
- Message storage and retrieval via a database (MongoDB / PostgreSQL) for persistence.
- User authentication and session management (JWT / NextAuth) for secured access.

## üöÄ Features

- Real-time chat between multiple users.
- Event-driven architecture using Kafka to handle message streams.
- Clean frontend UI built with React and TypeScript.
- Modular and extensible codebase suitable for scaling further.
- Persistence of chat history and user data.
- (Optional) Room creation, user presence tracking, message read receipts.
